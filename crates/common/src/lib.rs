/// # Safety
///
/// This is safe because it merely exposes the backing memory use natively to
/// store the instance of the type as a byte array.  It is tagged unsafe only
/// because of the pointer and slice operations involved.
///
/// Still, even though this won't result in memory leaks or dereferencing NULL,
/// it is still moderately unsafe as the direct memory storage layout may
/// change across architectures.  Be very careful with what you store or you
/// will get inconsistent results across platforms.
