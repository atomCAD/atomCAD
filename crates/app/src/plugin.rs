/// A collection of application logic and configuration steps that can be added to an [`App`] to

/// trait may be registered with an [`App`] instance.  When a plugin is registered, the plugin's
/// [`Plugin::initialize`] method is called, allowing the plugin to configure the [`App`] instance
/// as needed.

/// By default, a given type of plugin can only be added once to an [`App`], and this is enforced at
/// runtime.  This is a safety check as plugins may contain non-idempotent operations.  For plugins
/// which explicitly expect to be added multiple times, such plugins will need to override the
/// [`Plugin::is_unique`] method to return `false`.  This will allow the plugin to be added multiple
/// times to the same [`App`] instance (presumably with different parameters, e.g. a
/// `ConfigurationFilePlugin` that specifies a file to check on startup for runtime options, and
/// more than one file location is to be checked).
