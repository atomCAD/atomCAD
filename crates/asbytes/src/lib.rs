/// # Safety
///
/// This is safe because it merely exposes the backing memory use natively to store the instance of
/// the type as a byte array.  It is tagged unsafe only because of the pointer and slice operations
/// involved.
///
/// Still, even though this won't result in memory leaks or dereferencing NULL, it is still
/// moderately unsafe as the direct memory storage layout may change across architectures or even
/// across rustc versions.  Be very careful with what you store or you will get inconsistent results
/// across platforms.
